The diabetes is being treated with Metformin and Ozempic, with moderate control (A1C 7.2%) and early signs of nephropathy. The hypertension is being treated with Lisinopril 20mg daily with apparent compliance. The hyperlipidemia is being treated with Atorvastatin 40mg daily, but lab values remain elevated. All three conditions appear to be under active medical management. Family history is significant for father's early death from heart attack at age 55 and maternal history of diabetes.\"\n",
