=== FINAL UNDERWRITER ANALYSIS ===
Generated from analysis file: RGA_Underwriting_Pack_Cleaned_Full_page_analysis.json

=== RISK_ASSESSMENT ===
Primary risk factors include: 1) Lymphoma history with questionable resolution timeline (Feb-May 2019, p7), 2) Complex prescription history with risk score 2.650 (p17) indicating multiple undisclosed conditions, 3) Multiple benefit periods extending to 2039 (p17), 4) Regular alcohol consumption with multiple medications (p9). While current lab results are favorable (p15), systematic pattern of incomplete medical disclosure raises significant concerns.

=== DISCREPANCIES ===
Multiple significant discrepancies identified:
1. Lymphoma reported as resolved May 2019 (p7), but medication history shows ongoing treatment through July 2020 (p19)
2. No gastrointestinal conditions reported (p7) despite Ursodiol treatment May-Nov 2019 (p20)
3. No psychiatric conditions reported (p7) despite Amitriptyline history (p20)
4. No neurological conditions reported (p7) despite Gabapentin prescriptions (p19)
5. No dermatological conditions reported (p8) despite multiple skin medication prescriptions (p20)
6. No hematological conditions reported (p8) despite lymphoma history
7. Multiple benefit periods (p17) conflict with no-claims statement (p12)
8. Cardiovascular section shows multiple items checked then crossed out (p6)
9. Three-month lymphoma resolution claim (p7) appears inconsistent with medication timeline

=== MEDICAL_TIMELINE ===
2016-2017:
- Multiple pain medications and antidepressant prescriptions (p20)
2019:
- February: Lymphoma diagnosed (p7)
- March: Lorazepam prescription (p19)
- April: Started Prochlorperazine, Ondansetron, Tramadol (p19)
- May: Reported lymphoma resolution (p7)
- May-November: Ursodiol treatment (p20)
- August: Normal EKG clearing for chemotherapy (p11)
- August 2019-July 2020: Multiple Gabapentin prescriptions (p19)
2020:
- February: Last reported medical marijuana use (p10)
- July: Final documented Gabapentin prescription (p19)
- November: Last medical provider visit regarding marijuana use (p10)
- December 29: Case submitted (p17)
2021:
- January: Reports current alcohol consumption 1-14 drinks/week (p9)
- January 20-22: Paramedical exam and lab testing (p14-16)

=== FINAL_RECOMMENDATION ===
Decline application based on:
1. Systematic pattern of incomplete medical history disclosure across multiple categories
2. Questionable three-month lymphoma resolution timeline
3. Multiple undisclosed conditions evidenced by prescription history
4. Unclear cardiovascular history
5. Current alcohol use with multiple medications
Reconsideration would require:
- Complete oncology records with verified resolution date
- Full disclosure and documentation of all conditions indicated by medication history
- Explanation of cardiovascular history discrepancies
- Verification of benefit period details
- Medical evaluation of alcohol use with current medication profile
