  "RISK_ASSESSMENT": "Significant concerns about disclosure accuracy and medical history reliability:\n1. Lymphoma diagnosis (pg 1) with major timeline discrepancies\n2. Risk score 2.650 (pg 17)\n3. Multiple undisclosed conditions evidenced by medication history\n4. Form completion issues suggesting possible disclosure problems (pg 6)\n5. Current labs favorable (pg 15-16) but contrast with complex medication history\n6. Alcohol use 1-14 drinks/week reported (pg 9)",
  "DISCREPANCIES": "1. Lymphoma timeline inconsistent:\n- Claims resolution May 2019 (pg 7)\n- Medication history shows treatment through 7/2020 (pg 19)\n2. Multiple conditions not disclosed:\n- Neurological (Gabapentin use despite 'No' on pg 7)\n- Mental health (Amitriptyline despite 'No' on pg 7)\n- Gastrointestinal (Ursodiol despite 'No' on pg 7)\n- Dermatological (multiple prescriptions despite 'No' on pg 8)\n3. Current medication list shows only Claritin (pg 11) omitting extensive medication history\n4. Cardiovascular section shows multiple items checked then crossed out (pg 6)\n5. Claims normal physical/labs (pg 5) despite complex medical history",
  "MEDICAL_TIMELINE": "2019:\n- February: Lymphoma diagnosis, chest X-ray and CT scan (pg 7, 11)\n- March: Lorazepam prescription, Acetaminophen/Codeine (pg 19-20)\n- April: Started Prochlorperazine, Ondansetron, Tramadol (pg 19)\n- May: Claimed lymphoma resolution (pg 7)\n- May-November: Ursodiol treatment (pg 20)\n- August: EKG normal, chemotherapy (pg 11)\n- August: Started Gabapentin (pg 19)\n2020:\n- February: Last reported medical marijuana use (pg 10)\n- July: Last Gabapentin prescription (pg 19)\n- November: Last medical provider visit (pg 10)\n- December: Initial requirements received (pg 16)\n2021:\n- January: Application and lab work (pg 1, 15-16)",
  "FINAL_RECOMMENDATION": "DECLINE with no reconsideration recommended based on:\n1. Material inconsistencies in medical history disclosure\n2. Significant timeline discrepancies regarding lymphoma treatment\n3. Multiple undisclosed conditions evidenced by medication history\n4. Risk score of 2.650 (pg 17)\n5. Credibility concerns due to numerous discrepancies between reported medical history and medication records\n\nThe extent and pattern of discrepancies suggest potential material misrepresentation, making accurate risk assessment impossible without complete medical records and detailed explanation of all discrepancies."
